## How It Works

### Automatic Fallback System

Every page tries to fetch from Shopify first, then falls back to mock data:

```typescript
async function getProducts() {
  try {
    // Try Shopify first
    const data = await shopifyFetch<ProductsResponse>({
      query: GET_PRODUCTS_QUERY,
      variables: { first: 24 },
    });

    const products = data.products.edges.map((edge) => edge.node);

    // Use mock data if no products from Shopify
    return products.length > 0 ? products : mockProducts;
  } catch (error) {
    // Return mock data on error (like 401)
    return mockProducts;
  }
}
```

### When Shopify Credentials Are Added

Once you add real Shopify credentials to `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token
```

The site will:
1. Fetch real products/collections/articles from Shopify
2. Display real data if available
3. Fall back to mock data only if Shopify returns empty results

### No Mock Data for Product Detail Pages

**Note:** Individual product pages (`/shop/products/[handle]`) will show 404 until you either:
- Add real products to Shopify, OR
- Visit the products from the shop page (which uses mock data)

This is intentional - the product detail page expects a valid product handle.
